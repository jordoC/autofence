I. The Autofence Project: Purpose and Description
	
	The purpose of the project is to automate the manufacturing process of cabinet doors. More specifically,
	the part of this process which is to be automated is the filtering and selection of stile and crossrail
	frame material of the door as it is being cut to length. The goal of this project is to automate the fence
	used in this step of the manufacturing process, thus reducing fence manipulation time, and material selection
	and sort time.
